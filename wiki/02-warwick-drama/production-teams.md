### Publicity work:
publicity work involves the physical creation of marking media, this could mean drawing (by hand or computer) all elements of art used throughout the marketing campaign. It is the creative side of marketing focused on the artists and aesthetic vision for the campaign rather than the physical approach to marketing the show.
