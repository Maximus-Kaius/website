# Computer-Aided Design (CAD)

Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is the use of software to create 2D or 3D models and diagrams of your design. They can be
a great way to visualise your designs and how things fit together, especially when working with complex sets or trying
to fit a lot of things into a small space such as the studio.

Whilst many may think this is only applicable to the [set discipline](../../03-set/index.md), this is not the case. In
addition to visualising sets, CAD can be useful for:
* Creating LX plots/plans without doing this by hand.
* Creating sound pit/band layouts, especially for tight spaces.
* Calculating cable lengths for large rooms or outdoor events.
* Running LX pre-visualisation ('pre-vis') software for programming or designing LX cues in advance.

:::warning
Whilst CAD software can be a great tool, it is not always necessary and is often overkill! CAD designs can take much
longer to create than a simple pencil diagram, and the programs often have a large learning curve.

For Tech Crew shows, CAD should be treated more as an optional, advanced skill that should only be used if you have the
time and motivation to do it.

Popular software for technical-design CAD include:
* [Vectorworks](https://www.vectorworks.net)
* [Autodesk AutoCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview)

Ultimately (or at least for Tech Crew), the choice for which software to use is a personal one - there isn't a clear
winner. Most software is also very expensive for commercial use, but provides free plans for students/full time
education.
