# Demon & Ghouls Directory

List of the Demons and Ghouls that haunt Warwick Tech Crews operations. If something went wrong on show, use this page to identify which demon or ghoul was responsible.

## Studio Demon

First recorded evidence of the Studio Demon was during the show week for MTW's Godspell.
The Demon resided inside one of the WAC's EMS-81X speakers, which was being used as the main PA.
This caused a really annoying low hissing to be constantly output from the speakers.
No amount of tweaking the amp settings or swapping out cables was able to evict the studio demon from the speaker.
It is assumed that because of our attempts to remove the demon from its home, the demon turned off the PA power during preshow and decided to drop one of our mic packs on the floor just before the final number.
It should also be noted that the studio demon manifested itself as electrical current running through the walls behind the band-pit, in order to cause low hum feedback through the ban monitors via interference with the bass guitar.
Crafty demon.

## S21 Demon

This creature resides in WAC's DiGiCo S21 sound desk. During 23/24 Company, we very reasonably decided to load 200+ scenes into the main showfile.
The S21 Demon did not approve of this approach to DCA management, and subsequently cast a delay curse on the S21's next scene button, causing a lag of about 5 seconds each time a scene needed to change.
