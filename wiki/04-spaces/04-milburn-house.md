# Milburn House

Formerly home to the [CAPITAL Centre](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/capital/), then Theatre and Performance
studies, Milburn House is one of the strangest buildings on campus. We fairly regularly use G55, as one of the two
centrally timetabled drama studios (alongside [Avon](03-avon.md)), with G56 and G57 providing nice white-walled
rehearsal/studio spaces.

## G56 and G57

These rooms are rehearsal spaces with white walls. The sizes are a bit awkward as they're quite long and narrow vs the
more square shape of G55. G56 is a bit worse as it doesn't have the double height ceiling the other rooms have. These
rooms have no particular technical installations other than all having a 63amp 3-phase socket if you ever need lots of
power.

G57 in particular is not likely to be at risk as a room as the University marketing team do all their photo and video
shoots in there - keep an eye out in promo videos and you can recognise the distinctive patterns of the ventilation
system

## Building History

As mentioned above, Milburn houses G55, a fully fitted drama studio with tension grid, many dimmers, patching, etc.. G53
used to be a mirror image of G55 until it got turned into a physics lab in 2023. As a consequence, the control booth is
split into two, one room for each studio, though the window to G53 has been boarded over and the dimmer disconnected.

Elsewhere in the building is a wing that was the former home of Film and TV studies, another area that was created for
Warwick Writing Programme, as well as the the physics NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) facility.

Milburn House was originally a distribution warehouse before the University took it over as _space_ to do anything with,
which is why it's so weird. There was a great video explaining this (as a big sustainability success story), but it
seems to have disappeared so you'll just have to trust me on this one...

:::

After the arts and humanities departments moved to the FAB, much of this space became vacant in 2022. This lead to a speedy space
grab (as Warwick has a chronic shortage of space...) and now it houses a bunch of physics department spaces (mostly
astro), some engineering space, and some obscure centrally timetabled rooms. Most of it seems like an unloved child of
the uni, with none of the space making sense - with some very inconsistent one-way card access routes to get to certain
parts of the building.

During the early stages of the [STEM Connect programme](https://warwick.ac.uk/about/strategy/connect/stem/), the
architects had Milburn House marked out on the new plans. When asked if they had any plans for it (e.g. refurbs), they
said they had no actually plans and knew nothing about the building, but had been told they could use it as overspill
space for anything they couldn't fit in the main development...

The one part of the building that continues to receive investment is the NMR halls, which apparently have the most
powerful instruments in the country as a "National Research Facility". In 2020 they added a
[1 GHz spectrometer](https://deeley.co.uk/deeley-construction-completes-950k-university-of-warwick-lab-extension/), and
a [1.2 GHz one in 2024](https://www.quantem.co.uk/2024/05/20/start-on-site-for-milburn-house-at-warwick-university/). I
have no idea what this means but it costs a lot and sounds impressive (and is very entertaining to have next to a drama
studio). It is also annoying (as of Term 1 2024) as the building work blocks off the cut-through to Westwood.
