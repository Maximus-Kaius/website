In April 2015 the ceiling of Avon Drama Studio collapsed (with the lighting rig it once contained). This was
[thankfully reported with photos by The Boar in June 2015](https://theboar.org/2015/06/warwick-ceiling-collapses-without-warning/)
so we know it happened. It is unclear how long it took them to refurbish after, but the space was
[still not open in December 2015](https://theboar.org/2015/12/avon-drama-studio-remains-closed-for-repair/).
Unfortunately there is no a longer lighting rig (you can find some plans from the old one in the
[cupboard](../01-tech-crew/03-storage/other-storage/index.md#the-avon-cupboard)), and it seems the ceiling is lower than
it was before.
