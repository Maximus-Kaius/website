## [Get Involved](/opportunities)

To get involved with our events and join the society, please purchase membership from the
[Warwick SU website](https://www.warwicksu.com/societies-sports/societies/techcrew/) - this covers insurance, so it is
essential that you purchase this before you can setup or operate our equipment or work in some of our
[spaces](/wiki/spaces).

We operate over Discord and on a [hire/show project basis](/wiki/tech-crew/shows-hires) - so you can get involved
as much or as little as you wish. We also offer socials and training opportunities throughout the year, which are also
advertised on Discord. Please read our [Opportunities page](/opportunities) for more information.
